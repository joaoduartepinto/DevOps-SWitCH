# Ca2 - Part 1 -Demo Gradle

## 1. Downloading example

First, it is necessary to download the sample project.

You can download the Git repository, to a folder of your choice, through:

```
$ git clone https://bitbucket.org/luisnogueira/gradle_basic_demo.git
```

For the purpose of this course, the files were copied to the folder for this tutorial, not copying the .git folder.

## 2. Experiment the Application

All commands must be used via the terminal from the project root directory.

### 2.1. Build

To try the application, we have to build a .jar file. If we have a gradle installation on the machine, we can use the following command:

```
$ gradle build
```

If we haven't installed the gradle and don't want to install it, we can use the executable ./gradlew, which is present in the project:

```
$ ./gradlew <command>
```
